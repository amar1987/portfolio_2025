        recommendation: `Amar is iemand die goed weet wat hij wil en wat hij daar voor moet doen. Ook weet hij goed overzicht te houden op het grotere geheel waarvan zijn werk en die van het team, waar hij deel vanuit maakt, onderdeel is. Dit stelt hem in staat om een zinvolle bijdrage ter leveren aan de discussie over het nut en de noodzaak van verzoeken in het licht van de beoogde doelstelling(en), de doel architectuur en het ontwerpen van een oplossing.\n

        name: 'Marquis Landon',
        recommendation: `During a project with a European police agency, we (including Amar) were developing an open source intelligence application minimum viable product. The client wanted us to be able to code in react.js, for many reasons: 1. The client's stack was in react.js, and 2. The user- experience flows were much better.Amar understood angular.js, not react.js, but taught himself in a weekend how to code in react.js, which helped our project become successful insomuch that we developed a beautifully designed application.Beyond coding, Amar was dubbed our development lead because he was the glue for our development team.He helped set - up the integration pipeline and even pitched in to help on some backend chores.When our developers were stuck, Amar chimed -in and worked to help keep the project moving.Amar is a great developer, for he knows how to communicate, learn, and, most importantly, code.If you're looking for a great team player, a coder who can learn and iterate, and a strong developer, I could not recommend Amar enough!`

        name: 'Ingmar Kramer',
        recommendation: `Amar his Front End skills has been improving a lot during the BNPP Paribas project. Amar is eager to learn new best practices like SASS and lean code formatting. We worked closely together on the BNPP project and I really like the result of the structured, readable and optimised code we made with AngularJS/Ionic. At the start of the project Ionic was completely new for Amar. I had some small remarks about the code formatting but was very surprised how fast he knew how to use the AngularJS and Ionic frameworks. After a few weeks Amar already knew the power of the Ionic frame work to build nice looking mobile interfaces in a short amount of time. We were working each day closely together on new interfaces. Reviewing the build interfaces of each other and providing constructive feedback. Because of Amar his clear way of communicating and enthusiasm in front end development, the quality of the app was increasing every week. Also his code formatting has been improved a lot during the project. Amar knows now how to reuse SASS and AngularJS directives/services. Amar is a very hard worker. For the BNPP project he worked during evenings and even nights to finish work before we got into production. Because of Amar his input and effort, the deadlines were reached and we were still able to continue the project for BNPP. Next to his interest in front end development, he is also interested in the back end. This really is a great characteristic of Amar, which he can use for future projects. Amar is very friendly and shares the same interests as me. It would be a pleasure to work with him again in the near future! Especially on a Ionic and AngularJS 2 project. I think we are a great team together.`
